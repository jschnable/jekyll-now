I did my PhD in plant pathology with Richard Wilson in Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at University of Nebraska Lincoln from 2013 to 2017. During which I studied a devastating fungal pathogen causing blast disease preferentially on rice (now jumped to wheat) called Magnaporthe oryzae. I depicted the involvement of a master metaboilc regulator called the Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) and autophagy during the infection of rice by M. oryzae. Due to a strong interest in plant genomics and quantitative genetics, I joined Dr. Schnable Lab after achieved my PhD degree and started my journey towards giving insights on how transcriptomes and phenotypes were regulated by the variations of genomics of plants. I am also interested in how domesticated crops and their wild relatives differ in biotic and abiotic stress responses since wild relatives tend to exhibit unique and relatively wide spectrum of resilience to environmental stresses. Investigation on the genetic and molecular basis of the resilience retained/evolved in crop wild relatives can provide valuable insights on their evolution and future breeding.
