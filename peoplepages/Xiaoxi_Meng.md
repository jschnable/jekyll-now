Xiaoxi joined the lab in 2019 after she completed her PhD at Mississippi State working on rice proteomics. During her time in the lab she worked on both identifying targets for parallel genome editing and analysis of time series RNA-seq data from cold stress experiments in a range of grass species. In 2020 she and her husband Zhikai both moved to their primary postdoc positions at the University of Minnesota. Xiaoxi joined the [Shannon lab](https://shannonlabumn.github.io/) where she is working to develop a breeding program for diploid potatoes.
