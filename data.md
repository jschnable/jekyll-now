<i>Syntenic gene list for a bunch of species. Splits out maize1 and maize2 subgenomes. Uses maize v3, maizev4 sorghum v3, setaria v2.2 and rice v7 (among others). Constructed using LastZ to identify homologous genes, QuotaAlign to identify syntenic regions and python polishing scripts to identify high confidence orthologs within syntenic blocks. Maize v3 and maize v4 are treated as two separate species for the purposes of this analysis. Please cite <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.17.00354">Zhang et al 2017</a>. </i>

<a href="https://github.com/alejandropages/SLHTP"> <b>SLHTP</b></a> <i>- A set of software packages for automated image processing based phenotyping </i>
<br> Created by Alejandro D Pages, undergraduate researcher, 2018-19. 
<br> The Schnable Lab High Throughput Phenotyping (SLHTP) software package is written in python and houses the various scripts used in the development of three image processing software packages for automated phenotyping tasks. 
The tools available are:
* <b>beanpheno</b> A tool that can be used to process images of beans to obtain phenotype information for use in GWAS
* <b>kernelpheno (incomplete)</b> All the scripts and notebooks that were used in the development of a method to rate popcorn kernels for vitreousness from images taken on a light box. The image data was not collected with the intention of applying automated image processing methods in mind and therefore were too inconsistent for a simple method to be applied with good results. However progress was made towards that goal and perhaps a new data collection effort is warranted for the completion of this project.
* <b>earpheno</b> A set of tools that are useful for backend data management of a project involving <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/384974v1"> PhytoMorph</a>, a tool for extracting phenotype relevant measurements of maize ears.
