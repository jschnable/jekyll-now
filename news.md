### 2019, October

* James Schnable is the [inaugural Charles O. Gardner Professor of maize quantitative genetics](https://agronomy.unl.edu/news/schnable-appointed-endowed-professorship). Prof. Gardner was a leading researcher at UNL during the university's golden age of maize genetics. He trained countless students who contributed to both private and public sector plant science and breeding. His work combined innovations in molecular biology and statistical genetics and applied this work to the genetics and improvement of both maize and sorghum.
