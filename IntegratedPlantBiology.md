title: Applying to Integrated Plant Biology at the University of Nebraska Lincoln

### The Officially Unofficial Guide

The Integrated Plant Biology PhD track and the Complex Biosystems program of which it is part is one of the only interdepartmental graduate programs at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Students admitted to the program perform funded rotations with three different professors at UNL in their first year, while taking a core curriculum in biology and statistics with all first year students in the different Complex Biosystems graduate tracks. At the end of the first year, students join a research group sometimes with an individual mentor or more frequently with a primary advisor and a second co-advisor.

Students can apply to the Integrated Plant Biology track with either a bachelors or a masters degree.  

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Does Complex Biosystems Require GREs?**
Yes we do.

**Do you require a TOEFL?:**
If you are an international student, yes.  The program requires a minimum score of 550 on the paper exam or 79 on the online exam and an IELTS score of 6.5

**Is there a fee to apply:**
Yes $50. There is no official way to get a fee waiver through graduate studies. If you would like to apply to Integrated Plant Biology/Complex Biosystems and the fee is a barrier to you doing so, [write to Dr Schnable](https://www.unl.edu/psi/james-schnable).

**What do I need to apply:**
1. A CV
2. A personal statement (how long?)
3. Unofficial transcripts (with certified translation into english if they aren't already in english)
4. Contact Information for three people who could write you letters of recommendation.

It helps to list specific faculty you are interested in as part of your application. In deciding it can help to look at faculty websites or read the abstracts of recent papers published by individual professors in the program.
